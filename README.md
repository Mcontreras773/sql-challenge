# sql-challenge
I want to make note that I tried to keep up as much as I could with SQL, as it was a lot to absorb from the classes. I dont expect anything to be perfect but I am taking what I can from what I learned and applying it. I also apologize for the late submit as I was out of town and needed to do some catching up. Thank you for taking the time to grade and look over my work.
